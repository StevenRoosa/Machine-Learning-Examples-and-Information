# Background
These are a few simple examples of machine learning in Python.
It has been put together on an expedited basis, so apologies in advance for any snafus.
I have added Jupyter Notebook versions first, but will try and augment with 
flat Python script files in the future. 

# Jupyter Notebook
To get started with Jupyter Notebook, using Anaconda is the easiest, 
and <a href="http://jupyter.org/install.html">this is the place to go.</a>.

# Monty Hall - Bayesian Inference
The Monty Hall file in this repo is a simulation of the paradox of the same name, 
and is an example of Bayesian belief at work.
There is a great write up of the Monty Hall paradox on wikipedia:

# Neural Networks - TensorFlow
The TensorFlow file in this repo is an example using Google's machine learning platform,
specifically the neural network functionality.  The dataset comes from the breast
biopsy data made available here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data:
To get started on TensorFlow, this is where to go:

Adding K-Nearest Neighbor next ....

# Accountable Algorithms - Work of Dr. Josh Kroll et al.
For social implications and thoughts on accountability, 
I would direct folks to the work of Dr. Josh Kroll, PhD., and his work on 
Accountable Algorithms.  His paper of the same title is included in this repo 
(it is also going to be published in University of Pennsylvania Law Review, Vol. 
165, 2017, forthcoming).
