These are a few simple examples of machine learning in Python.
It has been put together on an expedited basis, so apologies in advance for any snafus.\n
I have added Jupyter Notebook versions first, but will try and augment with flat Python script files in the future.
To get started with Jupyter Notebook, using Anaconda is the easiest, and this is the place to go: http://jupyter.org/install.html.\n
The Monty Hall file is a simulation of the paradox of the same name, and is an example of Bayesian inference at work.
There is a great write up of the Monty Hall paradox on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem
The TensorFlow file is an example using Google's artificial neural network platform.
To get started on TensorFlow, this is where to go: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup
Adding K-Nearest Neighbor next ....

For social implications and thoughts on accountability, I would direct folks to the work of Dr. Josh Kroll, PhD., and his work on Accountable Algorithms.  His paper of the same title is included in this repo (it is also going to be published in University of Pennsylvania Law Review, Vol. 165, 2017, forthcoming).
